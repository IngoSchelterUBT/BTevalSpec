eval.yaml.0:
 - Add exctitations
eval.yaml.0.res:
 - Overall good significances
 - S1 seems to have very low strength (0.0004). I think the Pade at that energy showed a sharp artifact which was somehow accepted for the fit.

eval.yaml.1:
 - Remove S1 and refit

eval.yaml.1.res:
 - Good significances
 - Fit error 0.038
 - By looking at the difference between fit and ft, no obvious lines can be identified or rather distinguished from the error of larger lines
