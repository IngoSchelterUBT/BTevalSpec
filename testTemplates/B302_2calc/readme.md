# Description

This test is similar to the `B302` test. The only difference is that there is a second dipole moment from a calculation with a different external-field polarization.
This can be advantageous since there is less room for excitations that are (almost) orthogonal to the external field (and therefore difficult to fit).
On the other hand, the numerical position of the excitations can vary slightly, ultimatly increasing the line-shape errors that can spoil the fit.

Try to run as the `B302` test and compare the results.
